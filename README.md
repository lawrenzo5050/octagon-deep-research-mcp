   ```
2. **Install Node.js (includes npm and npx):**
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```
   This will install the latest version of Node.js, npm, and npx.

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   npx -v
   ```

### Windows

1. **Download the Node.js installer:**
   - Go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS version for Windows.
2. **Run the installer** and follow the prompts. This will install Node.js, npm, and npx.
3. **Verify installation:**
   Open Command Prompt and run:
   ```cmd
   node -v
   npm -v
   npx -v
   ```

If you see version numbers for all three, you are ready to proceed with the installation steps below.

## Installation

### Running on Claude Desktop

To configure Deep Research MCP for Claude Desktop:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config
3. Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` (Replace `your-octagon-api-key` with your Octagon API key):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deep-research-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "deep-research-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OCTAGON_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
4. Restart Claude for the changes to take effect

### Running on Cursor

Configuring Cursor Desktop 🖥️
Note: Requires Cursor version 0.45.6+

To configure Deep Research MCP in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Go to Features > MCP Servers 
3. Click "+ Add New MCP Server"
4. Enter the following:
   - Name: "deep-research-mcp" (or your preferred name)
   - Type: "command"
   - Command: `env OCTAGON_API_KEY=your-octagon-api-key npx -y deep-research-mcp`

> If you are using Windows and are running into issues, try `cmd /c "set OCTAGON_API_KEY=your-octagon-api-key && npx -y deep-research-mcp"`

Replace `your-octagon-api-key` with your Octagon API key.

After adding, refresh the MCP server list to see the new tools. The Composer Agent will automatically use Deep Research MCP when appropriate, but you can explicitly request it by describing your research needs. Access the Composer via Command+L (Mac), select "Agent" next to the submit button, and enter your query.
